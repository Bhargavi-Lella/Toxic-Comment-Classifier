The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. 
Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.
Our area of focus is the study of negative online behaviors, like toxic comments i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion.
We are building a model that’s capable of detecting different types of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. 
We’ll be using a dataset of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits. Improvements to the current model will hopefully help online discussion become more productive and respectful.
